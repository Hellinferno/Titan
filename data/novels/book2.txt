In Search of the Castaways

Chapter 1: The Shark
The crew of the Duncan caught a shark. Inside its stomach, they found a bottle with three notes written in English, French, and German. The notes were from Captain Grant of the Britannia, which had shipwrecked.

Chapter 2: The Error
Jacques Paganel, a geographer, boarded the Duncan by mistake. He intended to go to India but ended up on Lord Glenarvan's yacht. Paganel was known for his absent-mindedness. He decided to join the search for Captain Grant.

Chapter 3: Crossing South America
The search party traveled across South America along the 37th parallel. They faced earthquakes, condors, and storms.

Chapter 4: Thalcave
They met a Patagonian guide named Thalcave. He was a brave and stoic man who knew the pampas well. He saved the party multiple times. He had a horse named Thaouka. Thalcave helped them find water and navigate the wild terrain.

Chapter 5: Australia
The search moved to Australia. They met Aytron, who claimed to be a quartermaster from the Britannia. However, Ayrton was actually a traitor named Ben Joyce. He tried to seize the Duncan but was eventually captured.

Chapter 6: New Zealand
In New Zealand, the Maori tribe led by Kai-Koumou captured the travelers. Kai-Koumou was a fierce warrior. He imprisoned them, but they managed to escape to a volcanic mountain.

Chapter 7: The Rescue
Finally, they found Captain Grant on a lonely island called Tabor Island. Paganel realized his interpretation of the note was only partially correct, but chance led them to the right place.
