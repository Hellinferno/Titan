The Count of Monte Cristo

Chapter 1: The Arrival
Edmond Dantes returned to Marseille aboard the Pharaon. He was a skilled sailor and loved by the crew. However, Danglars, the supercargo, envied him.

Chapter 2: The Conspiracy
Danglars and Fernand plotted against Dantes. They wrote a letter accusing him of being a Bonapartist agent.

Chapter 3: The Interrogation
Villefort, the deputy public prosecutor, questioned Dantes. He was ready to let him go until Dantes mentioned a letter addressed to Noirtier. Noirtier was Villefort's father, a staunch Bonapartist and former revolutionary. Villefort burned the letter to save his own career and imprisoned Dantes in the Chateau d'If.

Chapter 4: The Chateau d'If
Dantes spent fourteen years in the dungeon. He met Abbe Faria, the mad priest. Faria was actually a wise scholar who taught Dantes history, science, and languages. Faria had spent years digging a tunnel to escape. He also revealed the secret of the Spada treasure on the island of Monte Cristo.

Chapter 5: The Escape
Faria died of a seizure (catalepsy). Dantes took his place in the burial sack and was thrown into the sea. He cut himself free and swam to safety.

Chapter 6: The Count
Years later, a mysterious Count of Monte Cristo appeared in Paris. He was fabulously wealthy and sought vengeance on those who betrayed him.

Chapter 7: Noirtier's Condition
Noirtier, now an old man, was paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his eyes. He lived with his son Villefort but secretly protected his granddaughter Valentine. He had a secret history as a Girondin during the Revolution.
